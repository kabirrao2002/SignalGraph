SignalGraph project overview

Alice Johnson, a researcher at OpenAI Labs, published a short note on efficient graph embeddings. The note references PyTorch and scikit-learn as the primary tooling used in experiments. Alice also mentions collaboration with BetaCorp Inc.

Key points:
- Graph embeddings improve retrieval.
- Implementation uses PyTorch 1.12 and NumPy.
